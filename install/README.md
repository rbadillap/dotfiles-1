# Installation

Download this repository and put it in your home folder. We can't just clone it 
cause we haven't got `git` installed yet.

Run `brew.sh` and `macos.sh` to install most used applications and to set mac 
os configuration.

Set `$VAGRANFT_CONFIG` to `$HOME/dotfiles/vagrant` and `$VAGRANT_DIR` to 
something like `$HOME/vagrant`.

Add `$HOME/dotfiles/bin` to your path and run `vinstall` to install vagrant 
development environement.
